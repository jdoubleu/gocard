# GoCard
GoCard is a learning platform based on an indexed cards system.

## State
This project is in development and **should not** be used in production!
There are many things todo, yet.

## Architecture
The **client** is a single-page application written in JavaScript using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
It communicates with a _REST_ API written in PHP using the [Flow Framework](https://flow.neos.io/).

## Motivation
We implemented this software as a project in our study computer science.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute in any kind.
Thank you for your time!
